### GitHub intro to IT assignment 1



### Personal information

### Name: Martin Björåsen
### Student Number: s3775649
### Email address:
S3775649@student.rmit.edu.au

### Basic background: 
I am a HVAC engineering student who has recently taken an interest in programming and I wish to develop my skills such that I am able to work as a software engineer. 



### Interest in IT:
My interest in IT stems from playing video games, and using engineering software(CAD) during my HVAC training. I am interested in creating software and tools that can be used to make certain construction / simulation operations easier to perform or much faster(referring to programs such as CAD). The reason for this is because after having used software of various kinds for so long, I have developed preferences and as such have certain ideas I want to see implemented. 

I chose RMIT as I believe RMIT will be able to provide the necessary skills I desire in order to fulfil my objective. The IT bachelor degree is going to be necessary if I want to work in any IT related field.

I am expecting to learn how to program software and to be more familiar with creating solutions to any problem I encounter.



### Ideal Job

In my opinion, a software engineer is akin to its namesake; an engineer who creates software to solve problems. The advertisement above seems to be a speciality geared towards creating administrative, software and making sure that the programs work correctly and also requires a degree of communication skills, as one is expected to partake in discussions of various kinds, e.g. one-on-one, online meetings, communicating information to team mates in groups, communicating information to customers / other employees.

With respect to the job requirements mentioned in the advertisement, I believe I lack the programming skills required to perform any sort of technical work for this job. My communication skills I believe are up to standard, but I do not have much experience being in meetings or directing / instructing others. 
To try and amend the problems I have, I will try to start small by making similarly small programs. Which will increase in complexity and size as my experience becomes greater. The idea is to take on as many and as varied tasks as possible to increase my knowledge and experience, with regards to programming. 
There isn’t much I believe I can do for my communication skills outside of preparing scripts and material, such that I can constantly refer to something as I attempt to convey information during meetings. I believe the key to being good at meetings, in my case, will be through preparation and experience.

NOTE: The authentic Myers-Briggs test requires money, which I am short of. As such I used a test which is allegedly based on the Myer-Briggs test.

The results of these tests do not really surprise me, as they are mostly in line with what I think of myself as well. 
The impact of these results is that I would be categorized within the “introvert” personality. This means that I need to be comparatively more expressive towards others when in a team or group related task, in order to better cooperate and complete said task.






### Project Idea: 3D Construction software


### Overview:
I would attempt to make a software that helps graphical designers recreate images into a 3D program. This program would be able to scan images, regardless of their dimension(the program would mostly use 2D pictures) and create exact  or very detailed copies of these. The program is also expected to be able to create this copy based on various artistic styles. So if the user has a 2D image, but dislikes the artistic style used to draw it, they can use this program to recreate the image, but in a different artistic style(e.g. turning a realistic picture into a cartoon). The program can also create an image based on being given a description by the user, using words. The program can be used to create static images, or moving animations.

### Motivation:
This program would be able to cut down the time it takes for graphical designers to design imagery such as video game characters, and 3D visualization programs. This will help graphics designers(such as animators) immensely as they usually spend an amount of hours animating minute long animations.

### Description:
The user would insert an image, either digitally as an imported file(which is supported) or via an image scanner (e.g. laser scanner). The user then asks the program to recreate the image it sees into whichever artistic font(cartoon font, 3D font, manga font etc) is desired. The user is also able to select a style of font/artistic design. Examples of cartoon artistic designs include the artistic design of the Disney cartoon “Fantasia: The Night on Bald Mountain”[ Jackson,W. Fantasia. 1940. [video] Directed by W. Jackson. United States: Walt Disney Productions.
], as well as that of the Disney cartoon “Gargoyles”[ Woodyard, D. Gargoyles. 1994. [video] Directed by D. Woodyard. United States: Walt Disney Television Animation.
]. The user may also change various variables about the image, such as the size of various components(if a humanoid character, limb sizes and proportions could be changed). The colouring and orientation of various components(if a building, windows and doors could be changed). The idea is that the user can change anything they desire about the image by using the program. 

After the user is satisfied with the image, the image is then recreated. Ideally the image should be recreated within the span of 5 minutes(regardless of its size), but will most likely take longer as the optimization and coding efforts required for this program to cut down time to that degree will be immense(and are not within my capabilities at the moment). 

The difference between using this program, and using another program such as 3D Blender, would be that this program is assigned all of the work involved in recreating the image; it is an automated program designed to cut down time, hence it attempts to create an image based on the precepts given by the user(via image or text). The user is then able to modify the created image after the program is done(using tools similar to 3D Blender / CAD), to account for anything that is still undesirable. 


### Tools and technologies:
To use this software, one would require a computer, a mouse, a keyboard, a reference material which will be recreated(an imported or scanned file). If the user is intending to use a physical object(e.g. image on a piece of paper) then a scanning device will also be necessary. 

The software is intended to run on Linux, Windows and Mac operative systems. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions will be available. The software, once payed for, can be downloaded digitally to the users computer.


### Skills required:
The skills required to make this project revolve around being able to program. The specific type of programming language could be in Java or Python(as I am more familiar with these) unless a more suitable option is found. 
One must have an understanding of how imaging works and be able to program the software to recognise imagery, such that it is able to automatically recreate all parts of an image. It is imperative that the program is able to interpret differences between parts of an image, and is able to understand that they are not the same(e.g. the difference between a hand, and a leg) and can generate the appropriate behaviour for that particular part.

All of the above requires experience in order to accomplish. So in my case, I need to perform more programming tasks to increase my understanding of programming, before I can attempt to create this program.

### Outcome: 
If the program is able to be realised, then this would be able to generate revenue for me personally. It would also be able to give graphical designers an option that allows them to save some time. Hence, they can spend more work hours doing other tasks outside of animating any particular imagery.

Though the program may be realised, this does not mean it will be without bugs, glitches or faults. The project will most likely require many optimisations and many work hours on my part, before it is realised or at the very least, at a usable stage of development.
